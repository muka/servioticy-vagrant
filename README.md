servioticy-vagrant
==================

Puppet is used to setup and launch all the needed components to run the servioticy API


##Requirements
* Vagrant 1.6 or newwer is necessary (see vagrantup.com for more information)

##Running  the instance

Now we are ready to run

`vagrant up`

If you want to update the components again, you can always run:

`vagrant up --provision`


You can then login into the instance running:

`vagrant ssh`

Now you can start or stop the servioticy services by running:

`start-servioticy` and `stop-servioticy`

or alternatively

`sudo servioticy start`

`sudo servioticy stop`

`sudo servioticy restart`


##Running on a standalone dev server

Install the software components on a machine not managed by vagrant.

It will create a user `servioticy` and install all the required packages in `/opt/servioticy`

Clone this repository in the machine to setup and run `sudo ./scripts/puppet-standalone.sh`

** Backup your system before proceeding as some operation may result in data loss **

##Notes

- The provision script handles either the configuration of the services, so use
`vagrant up --provision` when starting the VM.

- If you use Windows as your host system, note that you may encounter issues with the End-of-Line codification (CRLF in Windows vs LF in Unix/OSX). To avoid problems, use the following command in your git configuration (assuming you are not a developer committing code) before cloning this repository
`git config --global core.autocrlf false`

This Vagrant box is a complete refactor of an initial version developed by Luca Capra at CREATE-NET.
